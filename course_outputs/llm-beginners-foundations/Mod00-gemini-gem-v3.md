# 🎨 PREMIUM LIGHT COLOR PALETTE

Use light, professional backgrounds—never dark, heavy themes.

## Primary Palette: "Executive Premium"
```
Background: Pearl White #FAFAFA → Soft Grey #F0F4F8 (subtle gradient)
Text Primary: Deep Charcoal #2D3748
Text Secondary: Slate Grey #4A5568
Accent Gold: Refined Brass #C9A227
Accent Blue: Corporate Navy #1A365D
Highlight: Warm Copper #B7791F
Grid/Lines: Whisper Grey #E2E8F0
```

## Alternative Palette: "Technical Blueprint Light"
```

# 📝 ANNOTATION TEMPLATE (12-15 per slide)

Every concept slide must include extended annotations:

```markdown
Extended Annotations:
1. Core definition in plain English
2. Why this concept exists (the problem it solves)
3. When to use this approach (ideal scenarios)
4. When NOT to use (limitations)
5. Common mistake practitioners make
6. Memory/performance/compute implications
7. sklearn implementation: `sklearn.module.ClassName()`
8. PyTorch equivalent: `torch.module.function()`
9. Real-world application (consumer/everyday)
10. Industry application (business/enterprise)
11. Comparison with alternative approach
12. Pro tip from experienced practitioners
13. Historical origin or interesting context
14. How to debug when this goes wrong
15. Related concept (cross-reference)
```

---

# 🎯 BEGINNER'S CORNER TEMPLATE

Required on ALL concept slides:

```markdown
📖 BEGINNER'S CORNER:
• What this means: [Plain English, 5th-grade vocabulary. Use vivid real-world 
  analogy. Example: "Think of it like a GPS recalculating your route when you 
  make a wrong turn."]
• Why it matters: [Connect to their world with real examples. "In your phone, 
  this is how... In business, this helps..."]
• Common mistake: [Specific, actionable warning. "Never do X because Y. Instead, 
  always Z."]
```

---

# 🦉 WISDOM BOX TEMPLATE

Every slide ends with memorable insight:

```markdown
🦉 WISDOM (Lower-right bottom, 25% width, refined owl icon):
"[One-sentence insight that creates instant understanding. Use metaphor, 
contrast, or surprising connection. This should be quotable and memorable.]"

Examples:
- "Overfitting is like memorizing answers instead of understanding concepts."
- "The learning rate is your gas pedal—too hard and you crash, too soft and 
  you never arrive."
- "A neural network doesn't think—it pattern-matches at superhuman speed."
```

---

# ❌ THINGS TO NEVER INCLUDE

```markdown
NEVER include these in prompts:
- "[STYLE: ... - DO NOT DISPLAY]"
- "[5-PANEL DIAGRAM]" or similar meta-tags
- "16:9" or aspect ratio references
- "Kimi" or other tool names
- "v3 FINAL" or version markers
- "Footer:" or header/footer instructions
- Company names (BCG, McKinsey unless comparing quality)
- "(correct)" markers on any options
- "DURATION" or time references
- Panel numbers (Panel 1, Panel 2...) without descriptive labels
- Dark background colors (#0A. #1A, #2D ranges)
- Neon or electric accent colors
```

---

# 🎨 VISUAL DESCRIPTION TEMPLATE

Every visual description should be rich and cinematic:

```markdown
INSTEAD OF:
"Split comparison showing traditional vs ML"

WRITE:
"Premium split-screen visualization on pearl white background. LEFT: A rigid 
industrial assembly line with human operators at terminals, manually coding 
IF-THEN rules—mechanical, inflexible, dated appearance with grey tones. RIGHT: 
A luminous adaptive learning chamber with flowing data streams through 
crystalline neural structures—modern, self-improving, with subtle gold and 
blue accents. Holographic efficiency meter shows 'Adaptability: 100%' on the 
ML side. 45° isometric perspective, studio lighting with subtle rim highlights, 
premium materials: brushed titanium, glass, and precision-machined surfaces."
```

---

# 🏆 DESIGN PHILOSOPHY

```
1. PREMIUM FIRST: Every slide should look like it cost $1M to design
2. LIGHT IS RIGHT: Light backgrounds communicate openness and clarity
3. LOGICAL FLOW: Structure follows teaching, not arbitrary numbering
4. ANNOTATE RICHLY: 12-15 callouts create comprehensive reference
5. ANALOGIZE FREELY: Multiple analogies unlock multiple learning styles
6. REAL-WORLD CONNECT: Every concept ties to practical applications
7. NO CLUTTER: Clean prompts generate clean slides
8. ACCESSIBLE DEPTH: A 15-year-old understands, an expert finds value
```
